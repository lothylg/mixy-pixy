#Project description
This site is meant to spice up your cocktail game by providing option based on the alcohol and ingredients that you have on hand. The user will be able select the ingredients on the main page, then choose drinks on the second page. After they have tried the drink, they can manage their "drink cabinet" that will hold their thoughts about the drink and when they tried it. The user can also choose to make a different drink right on the second page.

In this project - website to be able to search a cocktail database for drinks based on ingredients that are on hand. 

GIVEN a website to make drinks based on ingredients on hand
WHEN typing in an ingredient
THEN autocomplete with options
WHEN clicking on an option
THEN autofills the search bar with what you clicked on
WHEN submit on front page
THEN takes to second page with results AND ability for new search
WHEN on the results page
THEN ingredients list and photos of completed cocktail will show and instructions on how to make (will possibly need a placeholder image)
WHEN a button for "I'm feeling lucky is pressed" 
THEN a random cocktail with ingredients, instructions, and photos will show. 
WHEN I click "I'm feeling lucky" too many times
THEN takes the user to taxi website
WHEN on the main page 
THEN we will see suggestions of popular drinks
**need something for extra library (javascript animation library) - autocomplete. (can't use npm, just use script tag)
WHEN I switch to a mobile
THEN the screen media will adjust
WHEN I have tried a drink
THEN click a button where a modal shows up and I can review the drink | store review in local storage
WHEN I am on the main page
THEN show drinks I have tried in the past and the review
WHEN on the main page
THEN we will see a slider of drinks (https://github.com/dynamicweb/swiffy-slider?ref=vanillalist)
